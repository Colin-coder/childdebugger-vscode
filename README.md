# Child Debugger - VS Code extension

Prototype code for a VS Code extension to support (Windows) child process debugging in VS Code.

This extension is supposed to work in combination with the "Concord" VS Debug Engine extension to be found at https://github.com/albertziegenhagel/childdebugger-concord
