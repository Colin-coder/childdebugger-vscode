# Child Debugger - "Concord" VS Debug Engine extension

Prototype code for a "Concord" VS Debug Engine extension to support (Windows) child process debugging in VS Code.

This extension is supposed to work in combination with the VS Code extension to be found at https://github.com/albertziegenhagel/childdebugger-vscode
